The scripts listed in this repository were used to analyse data from the Quijote simulatino on massive neutrinos to find neutrino wakes.

Neutrino wakes are a non-linear scale phenomenon caused by the gravitational focussing of neutrinos downstream of a moving dark matter halo. This is opposed to the linear scale phenomenon where a dipole in the density and velocity of neutrinos and cold dark matter (CDM) around a moving dark matter halo. This dipole has a high density at the front and a low density at the back and is easier to observe.
